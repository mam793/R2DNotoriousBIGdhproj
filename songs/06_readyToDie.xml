    [Intro: Puff Daddy]
    Yeah, yeah, you ready, motherfucker?
    We gonna kill your ass, kill your ass
    I'm ready
    
    [Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
    One in the chamber, the safety is off, release
    Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
    Biggie Smalls the savage, doin' your brain cells much damage
    Teflon is the material for the imperial
    Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
    I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
    Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive the Q-45
    Glocks and TEC's are expected when I wreck shit
    Respect is collected, so check it!
    I got techniques drippin' out my butt cheeks
    Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
    My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
    I'm ready to die, and nobody can save me
    Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
    My life is played out like a Jheri curl
    I'm ready to die!
    
    
    [Chorus]
    Yes, I'm ready
    Yes, I'm ready
    Yes, I'm ready
    So die, motherfuckers, die, motherfuckers, die
    
    [Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
    Doin' whatever it took, from snatchin' chains to pocketbooks
    A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
    I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sold
    I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
    Gettin' paid is all I expected
    My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?!
    Now I've got a Glock makin' motherfuckers duck
    Shit is real and hungry's how I feel
    I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
    Kickin' niggas down the steps just for rep
    Any repercussion lead to niggas gettin' wet
    The infrared's at your head real steady
    You better grab your guns 'cause I'm ready
    
    [Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    Yes, I'm ready
    Yes, I'm ready
    I'm ready to die
    Yes, I'm ready
    So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
    Nah, we ain't gonna kill your ass yet, we gonna make you suffer

    [Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    In a sec, I throw the TEC to your fuckin' neck
    Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some wreck
    Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talkin'
    You better act like CeCe, and keep on walkin'
    When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
    You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
    Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin'
    I'm rippin' MC's from Tallahassee to Compton
    Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
    Niggas say I'm strange, deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
    Make your shit splatter
    Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
    After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit
    Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin' shit drip
    The shit I kick rippin' through the vest
    Biggie Smalls passin' any test
    I'm ready to die!
    
    [Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    Yes, I'm ready
    Yes, I'm ready
    I'm ready
    Yes, I'm ready
    Time to go, we gon' put you out your misery, motherfucker
    Niggas definitely know what time it is (Yes, I'm ready)
    The Notorious one in full effect for '93 (Yes, I'm ready)
    Uhh, uhh Yes, I'm ready
    Suicidal, I'm ready!
    So die, motherfuckers, die, motherfuckers, die
    Yes, I'm ready
    So die, motherfuckers, die, motherfuckers, die
    
    
    [Outro: Puff Daddy]
    Now I lay me down to sleep (Yeah)
    Pray the Lord my soul to keep
    If I should die before I wake
    I pray the Lord my soul to take
    'Cause I'm ready to die
    (I'm ready, I'm ready)
    All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to
    (I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
    Biggie Smalls the biggest man
    (I'm Ready)
    Rockin' on and on in '93, Easy Mo Bee
    Third Eye and the rest of the Bad Boy fam
    I don't wanna see no cryin' at my funeral
