    <intro artist="Biggie PuffDaddy Girl">Yo let— let— let me ask you a question, yo
    Yo, would you kill for me?
    Hmm, yeah
    Uh, the act of making love— <adlib>Haa</adlib>
    What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
    I don't know
    The fuck wrong with you, bitch?</intro>
    
    <verse artist="Biggie">When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
    You look so good, huh, I'll suck on your daddy's dick
    I never felt that way in my life
    It didn't take long before I made you my wife
    Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
    Comin' to the crib, even had a set of keys
    During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
    In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
    But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
    Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
    And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
    I treat you right, <theme topic="violence">you talk slick, I beat you right</theme>
    </verse>
    
    <chorus artist="Biggie PuffDaddy Girl">Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
    <adlib>But you know you love that ass, don't you?</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch
    <adlib>Yeah, no question, no question</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>Yo, let me ask you another question</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>What?</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>You been fuckin' 'round on me?</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
    <adlib>Why would I do that?</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>Yo, don't lie to me, motherfucker</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch</chorus>
      
    <verse artist="Biggie">Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh, no, that's not my steelo
    I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo and craps
    Packin' gats in a Coach bag, steamin' dime bags
    A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
    With a bop just as strong as me
    Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
    Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
    One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
    Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
    I see my Polos and Timbos
    Hide my car keys so I can't leave
    A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
    And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
    She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
    And then we lie together, cry together
    I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together</verse> 
    
    <chorus artist="Biggie PuffDaddy Girl">Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>Nigga, nigga, if I ever</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch
    <adlib>Catch your ass fuckin' around</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>I'll cut your motherfuckin' dick off</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch
    <adlib>Haha</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>Stop playin'</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch
    <adlib>I ain't pl— ain't— ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah
    <adlib>Ain't no jokes</adlib>
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch
    <adlib>Yo, don— don't play with my dick</adlib></chorus>
    
    
    <verse artist="Biggie">She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
    Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
    One day, she put 911 on the pager
    Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
    No response, the phone just rung
    Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
    When I pulled up, police was on the scene
    Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
    Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
    Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
    It didn't take long before the tears start
    I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
    And I know it was meant for me
    I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
    And when I find 'em your life is to an end
    They killed my best friend, me and my bitch</verse>
        
    <chorus artist="Biggie">Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch, yeah
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch, uh
    Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch, yeah
    Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch, uh
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah
    Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
    Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch, yeah
    Just me and my bitch</chorus>
       
    <skit artist="Biggie PuffDaddy Girl">Let's get started then
    So when did you first start rappin'?
    Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18
    So how did you first get started? Who influenced you?
    Ain't nobody really influenced me, you know what I'm saying?
    I was just tired of being on the streets, you know what I'm saying? Had to get up off that, you know
    I see. So where you from?
    Brooklyn</skit>
