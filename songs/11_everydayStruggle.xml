        <style type="anecdote"><theme topic="reflection">I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
                Pockets broke as hell, <style type="collo">another rock to
                    sell</style> People look at you like you's the user</theme> Sellin' drugs to all
            the losers, mad buddha abuser But they don't know about your stress-filled day Baby on

            <theme topic="family">my moms hate me She was forced to kick me out,</theme> no doubt Then I figured out nicks went
            for 20s down South Packed up my tools for my raw power move Glock 19 for casket and
            flower moves For chumps tryin' to stop my flow And what they don't know will show on the
            autopsy Went to see Papi to cop me a brick Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin'
            to hear it Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court For an assault that I caught in
            Bridgeport, New York <style type="simile allusion">Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man</style> You better have your

    <verse artist="Biggie">I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland With my
        man Two-TECs to take over this projects They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs And when he
        start to bust, he like to ask, "Who's next?" I got my honey on the Amtrak <theme topic="drugs">with the crack In
        the crack of her ass, <style type="collo">two pounds of hash in the stash</style></theme> I wait for hon to make some quick cash
        I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed At last, I'm literally loungin', black
        <theme topic="money">Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks</theme> Had to re-up, see what's up with my
        peeps Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
        Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me
        harder We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter <theme topic="violence">Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never
        heard of</theme> By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners And my bitch swear to God
        she won't snitch I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich Conspiracy,
        she'll be home in three Until then I looks out for the whole family A true G, that's me,
        blowin' like a bubble In the everyday struggle</verse>

    <chorus artist="Biggie">I don't wanna live no more Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front

    <verse artist="Biggie"><style type="allusion">I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani Ain't tryin' to see no
        black man turn to John Gotti</style> My daughter use a potty so she's older now Educated street
        knowledge, I'ma mold her now Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes Dealin' with
        the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain The
        crack smoke make my brain feel so strange Breakin' days on the set, <theme topic="drugs">no sweat Drunk off MoÃ«t</theme>,
        can't bag yet because it's still wet But when that dry, baggin' five at a time I can clock
        about nine on the check cashin' line I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
        Thick in the game, D's knew my first name Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me
        scared Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes</verse>
