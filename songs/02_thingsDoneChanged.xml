        Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrappin' 
        Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens 
        When you sleep on the street 
        Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep 
        And we coming to the wake 
        To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake </theme>
