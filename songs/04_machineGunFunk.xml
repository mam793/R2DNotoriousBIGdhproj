        Yeah
    </intro>
    <verse artist="biggie">
        So you wanna be hardcore?
        With your hat to the back
        Talkin' about the gats in ya raps
        But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screamin'
        <style type="allusion">Maybe I'm dreamin'
        This ain't Christopher Williams</style>
        Still some MC's gotta feel one, caps I gotta peel some
        To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
        <style type="simile">I get up in that ass like a wedgie</style>
        Says who? Says me, the lyrical
        <style type="thirdPerson">Niggas sayin', "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"</style>
        Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
        Just for niggas actin' shifty
        Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill ya quicker
        <theme topic="drugs">Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
        Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks-es</theme>
        <style type="simile">It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates</style>
        The funk, baby
    </verse>
    <chorus artist="biggie">
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

        <theme topic= "sex">All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches</theme>
        <theme topic="wealth">Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
        Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
        From stayin' in my business, what is this?
        Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not</theme>
        <theme topic="lifestyle">Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
        Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
        Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
        Until we motherfuckin' meet again, huh
        I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
        Come on the Ave, I'm real hard to find now
        'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats</theme>
        In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
        For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the <adlib>blue suits</adlib>
        I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
        Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks

        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk" <adlib>Uh</adlib>
        "I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

        How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside</theme>
        Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
        Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
        The rocket launcher, <style type="thirdPerson">Biggie stomped ya</style>
        <style type="simile">High as a motherfuckin' helicopter</style>
        That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
        <style type="allusion simile">Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina</style>
        "What's love got to do..."
        When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?
        <style type="simile">Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns</style>
        <theme topic = "drugs lifestyle">I got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons
        Niggas wanna know how I live the mack life
        Makin' money, <style type="simile">smokin' mics like crack pipes</style>
        It's type, simple and plain, to maintain
