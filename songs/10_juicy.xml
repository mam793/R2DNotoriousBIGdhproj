    <intro artist="Biggie"><adlib>"Fuck all you hoes!" Get a grip, motherfucker!</adlib> Yeah, this
        album is dedicated <style type="anecdote">To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount
            to nothin' To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front
            of Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my
            daughter</style>
        <adlib>it's all good</adlib> And all the niggas in the struggle You know what I'm sayin'?
        It's all good, baby baby</intro>


    <verse artist="Biggie">It was all a dream, <style type="allusion">I used to read Word Up!
            magazine Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine Hangin' pictures on my wall Every
            Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl</style> I let my tape rock 'til my tape
        popped <theme topic="drugs">Smokin' weed in Bambú</theme>, sippin' on Private Stock Way
        back, when I had the red and black lumberjack With the hat to match Remember Rappin' Duke?
        Duh-ha, duh-ha You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far Now I'm in the
        limelight 'cause I rhyme tight Time to get paid, <style type="simile allusion">blow up like the World
            Trade</style> Born sinner, the opposite of a winner Remember when I used to eat sardines
        for dinner <style type="allusion">Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri Funkmaster Flex,
            Lovebug Starski</style> I'm blowin' up like you thought I would Call the crib, same
        number, same hood, it's all good And if you don't know, now you know, nigga</verse>

    <verse artist="Biggie">I made the change from a common thief To up close and personal with Robin
        Leach And I'm far from cheap, <style type="collo">I smoke skunk with my peeps</style> all
        day <theme topic="home">Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way</theme>

        they write letters 'cause they miss me I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff I
        was too used to <style type="collo">packing gats</style> and stuff Now honeys play me close
        like butter play toast From the Mississippi down to the East Coast Condos in Queens, indo
        for weeks Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak Living life without fear Puttin' five
        karats in my baby girl ear Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool Considered a fool
        'cause I dropped out of high school Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood And it's still
        all good And if you don't know, now you know, nigga</verse>
