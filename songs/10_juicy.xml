    <verse artist="Biggie">
        I made the change from a common thief
        To up close and personal with Robin Leach
        And I'm far from cheap, <theme topic="drugs"><style type="collo">I smoke skunk with my peeps</style></theme> all day
        <theme topic="home">Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way</theme>
        <theme topic="drugs">The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy,</theme> girls used to diss me
        Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
        I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
        I was too used to <style type="collo">packing gats</style> and stuff
        Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
        From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
        Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
        Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
        Living life without fear
        Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
        Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
        Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
        Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
        And it's still all good
        And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
