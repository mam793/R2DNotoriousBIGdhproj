    [Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    I used to get feels on a bitch
    Now I throw shields on the dick to stop me from that HIV shit
    And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
    Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
    Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
    Like Arnold on that, "What you talking 'bout, Willis?"
    The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
    Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
    Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
    I want the fucking fortune like the Wheel
    I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
    Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...
    
    
    [Verse 2: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
    ...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
    I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
    Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
    It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
    Coming where you rest at, surrender
    Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
    Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
    Nigga, stop bitching, button up your lip and
    From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
    Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
    Acting as if it can't happen
    Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
    Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
    So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
    I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
    It's real, '94 rugged-raw
    Kickin' down your goddamn door
    And it goes a little something like this
    
    [Chorus: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
    Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
    Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
    (Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
    (And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

    [Verse 3: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
    Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
    Meth-tical, putting niggas back in ICU
    I'm lifted, troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
    I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
    Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
    Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
    And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
    I spark and they cells get warm
    I'm not a gentleman, I'm a Method Man
    Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
    (Assume the position) Stop look and listen
    I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens, bitch
    
    [Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G. & Method Man]
    Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
    Cold as the pole in the winter
    Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
    And when my MAC unloads
    I'm guaranteed another video
    Ready to die, why I act that way?
    Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
    So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
    I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
    Excuse me, flows just grow through me
    Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
    It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
    A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
    (I got more Glocks and TECs than you)
    I make it hot, (niggas won't even stand next to you)
    Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
    Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so
    [Chorus: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
    Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
    And everything you get you gotta work hard for it
    (Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
    (And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch
    Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
    Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
    (Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
    (And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch
    
    [Outro: Notorious B.I.G. & Method Man]
    Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique in full effect (Yeah, what the fuck you want, nigga?)
    Ah, yeah, hell yeah (Biggie Smalls and Meth-tical)
    Bedfordâ€“Stuyvesant the livest one (9-4 coming at you raw)
    My borough is thorough (Shaolin Island, yeah)
    Recognize (Yeah)
