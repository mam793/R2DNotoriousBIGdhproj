        <theme topic = "relationship lifestyle">Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
        Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
        Wipe the cold out my eye
        See who's this pagin' me and why
        It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
        Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
        <style type="simile">Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper</style>, neighbor
        Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
        Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
        That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
        Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
        Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
        I didn't say them
        They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
        When you was clockin' minor figures
        Now they heard <style type="simile">you're blowin' up like nitro</style>
        And they wanna <style type="imagery">stick the knife through your windpipe slow</style>
        So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
        I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do</theme>
    </verse>
    
    <chorus artist = "biggie">
        Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
        Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
        Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
        Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
    </chorus>
    
    <verse artist = "biggie pop">
        <style type = "repetition"><theme topic = "wealth">They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
        With the Texas license plates out of state
        They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
        And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down</theme>
        They even heard about the crib</style>
        You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
        Call the coroner!
        There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
        If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
        What ya think all the guns is for?
        All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
        And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
        The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
        Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my <style type = "collo">cream</style>
        And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
        <theme topic = "lifestyle">It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
        Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya</theme>
        <style type="thirdPerson">Bet ya Biggie won't slip</style>
        <style type="imagery">I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
        So I can rip through the ligaments</style>
        Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
        Where all the foul niggas went
        <theme topic="lifestyle wealth"><style type = "collo">Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta</style>
        Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck</theme>
        <style type="imagery">I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
        Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
        Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
        So I can reload and explode on your asshole</style>
        I fuck around and get hardcore
        C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
        Feel the rough, scandalous
        The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
        I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
        <style type = "thirdPerson">What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?</style>
        I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
        Hold on, I hear somebody comin'
    </verse>
    
    <skit artist = "">
        C'mon, motherfucker
        Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
        Just gâ€” bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
        Are we gettin' close, huh?
        It's right over here
        You sure it's Biggie Smalls crib, man?
        Yeah, I'm sure, motherfucker, come on
        Man, fuck, this better be his motherfuckin' house
        Fuck, right here
        Tsk, this better be this motherfucker's house
        Oh shit
        What? What's wrong?
        What's that red dot on your head, man?
        What red dot?
        Oh shit! You got a red dot on your head, too
        Oh shit!
    </skit>
