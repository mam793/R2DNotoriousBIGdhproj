<song>[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Pop]
    Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
    Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
    Wipe the cold out my eye
    See who's this pagin' me and why
    It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
    Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
    Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
    Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
    Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
    That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
    Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
    Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
    I didn't say them
    They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
    When you was clockin' minor figures
    Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
    And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
    So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
    I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do
    
    
    
    [Chorus]
    Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
    Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
    Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
    Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
    
    [Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Pop]
    They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
    With the Texas license plates out of state
    They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
    And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
    They even heard about the crib
    You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
    Call the coroner!
    There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
    If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
    What ya think all the guns is for?
    All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
    And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
    The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
    Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
    And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
    It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
    Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
    Bet ya Biggie won't slip
    I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
    So I can rip through the ligaments
    Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
    Where all the foul niggas went
    Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
    Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
    I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
    Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
    Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
    So I can reload and explode on your asshole
    I fuck around and get hardcore
    C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
    Feel the rough, scandalous
    The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
    I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
    What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
    I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
    Hold on, I hear somebody comin'
