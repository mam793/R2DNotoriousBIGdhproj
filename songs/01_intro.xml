Push
C'mon, shorty, stay push, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, push it's almost there
One more time, c'mon
C'mon, push, baby, one more time
Harder, harder, push it harder
Push, push, c'mon
One more time, here it goes
I see the head!
Yeah, c'mon!
Yeah! Yeah!
You did it, baby, yeah!
[Interlude]
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand what a hell of a man...

Hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
Rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang
The boogie to the boogie that be
Now, what you hear is not a test...

[Skit: 'Prince' Charles Alexander]
God damn it, Voletta, what the fuck are you doin'?
You can't control that God damn boy? What?
I just saw Mr. Johnson, he told me he caught the motherfucking boy shoplifting
What the fuck are you doin'? (Get your black ass the fuck off!)
You can't control that God—
I don't know what the fuck to do with that boy
What the fuck do you want me to do?
If— if you can't con— fucking control him
I'ma send him— (All you fucking do is bitch all day, motherfucker)
I'ma send him— Bitch, bitch, I—
I'ma send his motherfuckin' ass to a group home God damn it, what?
I'll smack the shit outta you, bitch! (Kick my black ass, motherfucker!)
What the fuck?
Yo— You— You are fucking up (Comin' in here, smellin' like sour socks, you dumb motherfucker)
I'ma fuck you up
