    [Chorus: Diana King]

    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend
    
    
    [Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
    My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
    Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
    Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call hurl
    Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
    I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
    Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
    New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
    Then came the worst date, May 21st
    2:19, that's when my mama water burst
    No spouse in the house so she rode for self
    To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
    Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
    I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
    I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
    The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"
    
    [Chorus: Diana King]
    Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend
    
    [Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
    On the drug scene, fuck a football team
    Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
    Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
    I mean, I want to blow up, stack my dough up
    So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
    Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
    Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
    Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
    Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
    Rap was secondary, money was necessary
    Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
    C74-Mark 8 set me straight
    Not able to move behind the great steel gate
    Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
    All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

    [Chorus: Diana King]
    Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend
    Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend
    
    [Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
    Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
    Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
    Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
    Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
    As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
    Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
    And to my niggas living street life
    Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
    Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
    In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
    If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
    Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC
    Respect to the macks in the Ac's
    To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps
    
    
    [Chorus: Diana King] X2
    Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend
    
    [Post-Chorus: Diana King]
    Now this is Diana King doing a Yankee thing
    In a Biggie Small's thing, do it, Ja

    The hardcore thing we ah deal with
    Oh yes, we are the best
    No other guy can test
    
    [Skit: The Notorious B.I.G. & Faith Evans]
    Shit, Mami, damn, why you actin like that, man?
    'Cause I don't be doin' this
    I'm sayin', you know it ain't nothin'
    It's just part of sex, ya know'm saying
    But you know I don't do this
    I don't even know how to do this
    I'm just sayin', jusâ€” just a little peck Mami, for daddy
    Just a little peck
    Like that?
    That's what I'm sayin', yeah
