    <verse artist="Biggie">1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
    <theme topic="family">My moms is late so I had to plan my escape</theme>
    Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
    <theme topic="drugs">Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call hurl</theme>
    Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
    I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
    Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
    New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
    <theme topic="family">Then came the worst date, May 21st
    2:19, that's when my mama water burst
    No spouse in the house so she rode for self
    To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help</theme>
    Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
    I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
    I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
    The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"</verse>
      
    <chorus artist="DianaKing">Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend</chorus>   
    
    <verse artist="Biggie"><style type="anecdote">Now I'm thirteen, <theme topic="drugs">smoking blunts</theme>, making cream
    <theme topic="drugs">On the drug scene, fuck a football team</theme>
    Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
    Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
    I mean, <theme topic="money">I want to blow up, <style type="collo">stack my dough up</style></theme>
    So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
    <theme topic="family">Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
    Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself</theme>
    Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
    <style type="allusion">Scarface, King of New York,</style> I want to be it
    <theme topic="reflection">Rap was secondary, money was necessary
    Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary</theme>
    C74-Mark 8 set me straight
    Not able to move behind the great steel gate
    Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
    All the money I stacked was all the money for bail</style></verse>
     
    <chorus artist="DianaKing">Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend
    Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem

    <verse artist="Biggie"><style type="anecdote">Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
    <theme topic="family">Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising</theme>
    Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
    Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
    As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
    Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
    And to my niggas living street life
    Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
    Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
    <style type="collo">In the streets without a gat?</style> Nah, nigga you're slipping
    If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
    Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC
    Respect to the macks in the Ac's
    To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps</style></verse>
    
    <chorus artist="DianaKing">Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
    Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
    Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
    Informer lone keep informer friend</chorus>

    But you know I don't do this
    I don't even know how to do this
    I'm just sayin', jusâ€” just a little peck Mami, for daddy
