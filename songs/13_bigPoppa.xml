    [Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    Uh, uh, check it out (Yeah), uh
    Junior M.A.F.I.A., uh (He-he)
    Uh (I like this) yeah, yeah
    Nine-fo' (Keep bangin')
    
    [Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
    Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes (Uh)
    Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
    The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me (What?)
    The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me (Uh)
    Mad question askin', blunt passin'
    Music blastin', but I just can't quit
    Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with (That's right)
    Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not? (Uh)
    Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
    Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
    Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy (Come on)
    No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
    C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players (Uh)
    Jump in the Rover and come over, tell your friends jump in the GS3
    I got the chronic by the tree cuz (Let's go)
    
    
    [Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    To the honeys gettin' money, playin' niggas like dummies
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    You got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)
    'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby (Uh), baby (Uh)
    
    [Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
    Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
    Who they attractin' with that line (What?), "What's your name? What's your sign?"
    Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind (That's right)
    And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
    Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
    You gon' be here for a while? I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
    We can rendezvous at the bar around 2 (Come on)
    Plans to leave, throw the keys to Little Cease (Uh-huh)
    Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
    So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly (G)
    A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
    Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
    What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (True)
    Forget the telly—we just go to the crib
    And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke Ls while you do me

    [Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player (Come on, yeah)
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    To the honeys gettin' money, playin' niggas like dummies (Uh)
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    You got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)
    'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby (Uh)
    
    [Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    (How you livin', Biggie Smalls?) In mansion and Benzes
    Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
    Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream (Heh)
    Still tote gats, strapped with infrared beams (That's right) (What?)
    Choppin' Os (Uh-huh), smokin' la in Optimos
    Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows (All a nigga knows)
    A foolish pleasure? Whatever
    I had to find the buried treasure (For what?), so grams I had to measure
    However, livin' better now, Coogi sweater now
    Drop top BMs, I'm the man, girlfriend
    
    [Interlude: Puff Daddy]
    Yeah, honey, check it
    Tell your friends to get with my friends
    And we can be friends
    Shit, we can do this every weekend (That's right), alright?
    Is that aight wit' you?
    Yeah, keep bangin'
    
    
    [Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    To the honeys gettin' money, playin' niggas like dummies (Uh)
    I love it when you call me Big Poppa
    You got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)
    'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby (Uh)
