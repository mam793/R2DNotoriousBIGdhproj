        Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die</theme>
        That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
        Have his mother singin', "It's so hard"

        Because the nigga play pussy
        That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed

        Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
        <theme topic="wealth">Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
        Up the herringbones and bamboos

        <style type="simile">I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille</style>, shit is real

        Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
        The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
        Oh shit, the cops
        Be cool, fool
        They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
        So why the fuck he keep looking?
        I guess to get his life tooken
        I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
        Oh shit, now he looking in my face
        You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
        So lace up your boots, 'cause I'm about to shoot
