  Just Playing (Dreams)
    As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks 
    Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex 
    I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
    Ooh, Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
    Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary 
    Wait a minute, what about my honey, Mary? Them jeans, they fitting like a glove 
     I had a crush on you since Real Love, huh 
     Hold your horses I'ma show you who the boss of intercourse is 
     Sex, I'm taking no losses 
    Even groups like SWV and TLC can't see B.I.G. with telepathy 
    The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun 
    Pimpin' ain't easy, but it sure is fun
    When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one 
    So what's the 4-1-1, hun?  Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin') Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')  Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')   Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
     I'll put Chanté Moore pussy in stitches 
    I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly-ass Xscape bitches 
    You can 76 the 69, try 68 
     Make Raven-Symoné call date rape
     Only 'cause I'm paid, I'm fucking all of Jade 
     And my DJ Zhané, he likes it when they say "Everybody move your body" 
    Got Whitney Houstonboosting from Bobby
     As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terri
     Back shots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy 
    Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight 
    Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
    Smoke a stoge, fuckin' En Vogue because it's four of them   Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them 
    (What about Toni Braxton?) 
    If that bitch give me action, guaranteed satisfaction
     Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
    Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')  Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')   Dreams of fuckin' an R&amp;B bitch (I'm just playin, but I'm sayin') 
    You know what I'm sayin', Tim, man? 
    I ain't tryna diss the honeys 
    You know what I'm sayin'?(I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
     I just be buggin', you know what I'm sayin'?
    I ain't tryna disrespect nobody, you know? 
     I'm just buggin' out, you know? (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
    You know the flavor of the Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique
    Know what I'm sayin'? 
     Buttnaked Tim Dawg in the motherfuckin' house 
    I'm just playin' (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
    We're just havin' a little fun 
    Ain't no harm done, B(I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
    But I would hit all of y'all
