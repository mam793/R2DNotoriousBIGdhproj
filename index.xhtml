            <p> In 1994 Notorious B.I.G. released the album Ready to Die which to some is considered one of the best Rap albums of all time.
             The album tells the story of Christopher Wallace (aka Notorious BIG) and his life growing up on the streets of Brooklyn NY, the hardships he endured, and how he used rap as an outlet, ultimately leading to his fame.
             Containing a total of 19 songs, this album has undoubtedly had a profound impact on the rap industry. <span class="mark">Our goal for this project was to get a better understanding of Biggie's artistic style
             by examining the different stylistic features and themes he utilizes throughout the album that help facilitate its narrative style. We used these findings to draw conclusions about Biggie's strategy as an
             an artist and how his legacy may have contributed to the state of the rap game today.</span> </p>

                <p>In 1994 Notorious B.I.G. released the album Ready to Die which to some is considered one of the best Rap albums of all time. The album tells the story of Christopher Wallace (aka Biggie) growing up on the streets of Brooklyn selling drugs, the hardships it had brought upon him, and using rap as an outlet which ultimately led to his fame. Containing a total of 19 songs, this album has undoubtedly had a large impact on the rap industry. </p>
                   <p>To better understand the nuances in Biggie’s storytelling style, we first came up with a list of elements we wanted to markup with XML in his songs. These categories were theme, structural elements, and stylistic elements. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Theme: We found that the most prominent themes in this album were: </h4>
                
                   <ul>
                 <li>Sex</li>
                 <li>Money</li>
                 <li>Drugs</li>
                 <li>Family</li>
                 <li>Relationships</li>
                 <li>Violence</li>
                 <li>Home</li>
                 <li>Reflection</li>
                   </ul>
                    
                   <p>Structural Elements: When marking up the text, we looked for: </p>
                
                   <ul>
                   <li>Title</li>
                   <li>Intro</li>
                   <li>Verse</li>
                   <li>Chorus</li>
                   <li>Outro</li>
                   <li>Features</li>
                   <li>Adlibs</li>
                  <li> Talking and narration vs rapping</li>
                  <li>Interlude/Intro Songs</li>
                  <li> Speaker</li>
                   </ul>
                    
                    <p>Stylistic Elements: After looking through the corpus of songs, we found it important to mark  these stylistic elements: </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                   <li> Repetition</li>
                   <li>Allusion</li>
                   <li> Type, Person</li>
                   <li>Slang/Colloquial Terms (which we marked as “collo”)</li>
                   <li>Repetition</li>
                   <li>Onomatopoeia</li>
                   <li>Dialogue</li>
                   <li>Hyperbole</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>In our schema, for title and artist, we included attribute elements to further define these markups. 
                    For the title, we included a theme attribute which we defined by any of the themes we listed above. 
                    For the artist element, we included a name attribute that highlighted what artist was rapping/singing that line. 
                    This was an important attribute to incorporate because Biggie has many features on this album, and those features are a component of his artistic choices. 
                    </p>
                
                
                    <p>
                        *Disclaimer* 
                        Song number 8, "Fuck Me (Interlude)" is included but is not marked up because we didn't feel it was substantial enough to mark up. But, for the sake of being able to view the albmum conhesively, we wanted to include it, unmarked, in the reading view.

                <p>Christopher Wallace was born May 21, 1972 in Brooklyn New York. His mother, Voletta Wallace, raised him on her own; his father left them when Christopher was 2 years old. 
                His mom worked two jobs with long hours to provide for them. Biggie began selling drugs at the age of 12 to help provide for him and his mom. Due to his mother's long hours, 
                she had no idea what he was up to. At the age of 17, Christopher dropped out of high school and began pursuing street life, which included hustling drugs. After recieving 5 years of probabtion
                due to weapons possesion charges, then serving 9 months in prison for drug charges, Christopher decided to make a demo titled 'Let's Do It Againt' under the name 'Biggie Smalls'. The demo gained tremendous
                popularity, leading Biggie into the arms of producer Sean "Puffy" Combs aka Puff Daddy and his label Bad Boy Records in 1992. Fast forward to 1994 and we have the release of Biggies album 'Ready To Die'.
                This album was certified gold within two months, double-platinum the following year, and eventually quadruple-platinum. "Big Poppa," the second of the album's four singles, was nominated for a Grammy
                for best rap solo performance.</p>

                <p>My favorite song on the album is track 14 'Respect'. In this song Biggie narrates the timeline of his life from birth to fame. My favorite verse is when he 
                talks about him being in his mothers womb.</p>
