        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p> In 1994 Notorious B.I.G. released the album Ready to Die which to some is considered one of the best Rap albums of all time.
         The album tells the story of Christopher Wallace (aka Notorious BiG) and his life growing up on the streets of Brooklyn NY, the hardships he endured, and how he used rap as an outlet, ultimately leading to his fame.
         Containing a total of 19 songs, this album has undoubtedly had a profound impact on the rap industry. <span class="mark">Our goal for this project was to get a better understanding of Biggie's artistic style
         by examining the different stylistic features and themes he utilizes throughout the album that help facilitate its narrative style. We used these findings to draw conclusions about Biggie's strategy as an
         an artist and how his legacy may have contributed to the state of the rap game today.</span> </p>
